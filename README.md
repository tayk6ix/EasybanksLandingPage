### What I learned

Wow! What an amazing projects. 

To start off, I've learned the extent of my layout skills. I am proud to say that it took 1 day to finish this project. Although there were some obstacles along the way, I feel like they were within my reach of understanding and solving.Very glad to know my layout skills are set for me.

Now, my drive to knowledge of JS is always gonna be there, I feel like it's something that is very difficult to learn. But I am taking baby steps and in this project I learnd how to use some JS properties such as OnClick and IsClicked, also, a little bit of functions of as well.

```js
function FixScrollToggle (node) {
    var target = document.body;
    
    function isClicked () {
      return target.classList.contains('fixScrollToggle--on');
    }...
```

### Continued development

I realize how much my potential was with this project. That being said I also am excited to jump into harder challenges. And by that I mean more JS related projects.
